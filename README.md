TypeScript library to build web services, based on `express`, `koa` and `fastify`, with few developer-centric updates in debugging and programming bigger applications.

### Motivation

- Create a small library to build different kinds of applications (`serverless`, `microservices`, `websockets` or `rest`)
- Out-of-box configuration with integrated CLI (optional)
- Performance similar to `fastify` by usage of similar libraries, and code for performance.
- Support for `express` middleware.
- Getting rid of support to templating engines.

### Planned features

- [ ] Robust routing
- [ ] High-Performance (~60k req/s)
- [ ] Extensions, application be extendable with middleware and plugins.
- [ ] Logging, integration of dedicated logger into application.
- [ ] Complete support for `async/await` functions
- [ ] TypeScript build-in
